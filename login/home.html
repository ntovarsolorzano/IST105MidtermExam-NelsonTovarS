          <h3>Ecuador</h3>
          <p>Ecuadorian culture places a strong emphasis on courtesy and respect. Greetings are often warm and involve
            handshakes or cheek kisses (between women or a man and a woman). Addressing people using formal titles
            (Señor/Señora/Señorita) demonstrates respect, especially when interacting with elders or those in positions
            of authority. Direct eye contact is considered a sign of sincerity and attentiveness during conversations.
            It's also customary to offer small gifts when invited to someone's home. Punctuality is viewed more
            flexibly, and arriving a little late for social gatherings isn't generally considered rude. However,
            punctuality is expected in professional settings.</p>
          <p>Family plays a central role in Ecuadorian society, and family gatherings are frequent and important.
            Community ties are also strong, and helping others is highly valued. Bargaining is common in markets and
            informal settings, but it's important to do so respectfully and good-naturedly. Public displays of affection
            are generally acceptable, but excessive displays might be viewed as inappropriate. Dress codes tend to be
            more formal in professional and some social settings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="country">
          <h3>Canada</h3>
          <p>Canadian culture is characterized by politeness and inclusivity. "Please" and "thank you" are frequently
            used, and holding doors open for others is a common courtesy.
            Greetings typically involve handshakes or a simple nod and a verbal greeting. Addressing people by their
            first names is generally acceptable, even in professional
            settings, unless otherwise indicated. Direct eye contact is considered a sign of respect and attentiveness
            during conversations. Punctuality is highly valued in both
            social and professional contexts.</p>

          <p>Canadians are generally reserved and avoid overly expressive displays of emotion in public. Personal space
            is important, and it's considered polite to maintain a
            comfortable distance during conversations. Tipping is customary in restaurants, bars, and for services like
            taxis and haircuts. Conversations about politics, religion, and personal finances are generally avoided in
            casual social settings. Dress codes are generally relaxed, but appropriate attire is expected in
            professional settings and some social occasions. Canada is a multicultural country, and respecting cultural
            diversity is a core value.</p>

      <p>Ecuadorian cuisine is a vibrant reflection of the country's diverse geography and cultural influences. From the
        Andean highlands to the Amazon rainforest and the Pacific coast, each region boasts its own unique culinary
        traditions. In the mountains, hearty dishes like locro de papa (potato soup), cuy asado (roasted guinea pig),
        and seco de pollo (chicken stew) are staples. Seafood, including ceviche and encocado de pescado (fish cooked in
        coconut milk), is popular along the coast. Tropical fruits like bananas, plantains, and mangoes are abundant and
        often incorporated into both sweet and savory dishes. Llapingachos (potato pancakes with cheese) and empanadas
        are popular snacks. Ecuadorian cuisine is known for its use of fresh ingredients and bold flavors. Traditional
        drinks include chicha morada (a sweet purple corn beverage) and various fruit juices.</p>

      <p>While Canada's culinary landscape is influenced by its immigrant populations, some distinctly Canadian dishes
        and food traditions have emerged. Poutine, a dish of French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy, is perhaps
        the most iconic Canadian food. Maple syrup, derived from the maple tree, is a beloved national symbol and used
        in a variety of sweet treats, including pancakes, waffles, and maple taffy. Salmon, caught in the Pacific and
        Atlantic oceans, is a popular protein source, often grilled, smoked, or baked. Butter tarts, small pastries
        filled with a sweet buttery filling, are another Canadian favorite. Regional specialties exist across the
        country, from Montreal smoked meat to Nova Scotian lobster rolls. Canadian cuisine also reflects its
        multiculturalism, with diverse dishes from around the world readily available.</p>

      <p>Ecuadorian culture is rich in artistic expression, with traditions rooted in indigenous heritage, Spanish
        colonialism, and contemporary influences. Music plays a vital role in Ecuadorian life, with diverse genres
        reflecting the country's regional variations. Andean music, characterized by instruments like the panpipes,
        flutes, and charango, is prevalent in the highlands. Coastal music features rhythms influenced by African
        traditions. Traditional dances, often performed during festivals and celebrations, tell stories and express
        cultural identity. Ecuadorian art includes colorful textiles, intricate pottery, and wood carvings. Literature,
        poetry, and storytelling are also important forms of cultural expression. Major festivals, like Inti Raymi
        (Festival of the Sun) and Carnival, showcase the country's vibrant cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>Canadian arts and entertainment reflect the country's multiculturalism and vast geography. Music scenes thrive
        in major cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, fostering diverse genres from indie rock and hip-hop to
        classical and folk. Canadian cinema and television production have gained international recognition, with
        notable filmmakers and actors contributing to the global entertainment industry. Indigenous arts and culture
        play a significant role in Canada, with traditional crafts, storytelling, and music passed down through
        generations. From the vibrant street art scene in Montreal to the world-renowned theater festivals in Stratford
        and Shaw, Canada offers a diverse range of cultural experiences. Major events like the Toronto International
        Film Festival and the Montreal Jazz Festival draw international audiences and celebrate artistic achievement.
